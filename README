Wellcome to ElpAPI the python API for the Elphel cameras

this API serves the purpose of helping developers create applications that use the Elphel camera.
in this repository there are two kinds of script, the scripts, and the meta scripts,

scripts are the code that use the matascripts of the API, and the metadcripts are the code that conforms the API

the core of the API is in the matascript ElpAPI.py, and autosetup.py is the script that autosetups the camera,
if you want to know how it works you might chek both of those scripts
